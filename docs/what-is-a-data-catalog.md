## What is a Data Catalog?

Here’s a short story to help you understand the definition and value of a data catalog.

Two data scientists walk into a library at the end of a long day....

**Data scientist #1:** “Can I get a copy of this book on statistical methods?”  
**Data scientist #2:** “That book is super obscure. They’ll never be able to find it.”  
**The librarian** (clacks away on the keyboard for a couple of seconds before replying): “Found it! Here are the details of its author, publishing house and borrowing history. Oh, and someone left a comment saying they found it super useful for understanding logistic regressions. I can grab it for you in a jiffy.”  
**Data scientist #1:** “Ummmm… why can’t the same thing happen with our data?”

But what if it could? And it turns out, that’s exactly what a data catalog can help you do.

Ok, enough of the simple explanations. Here’s a more serious answer to the question, "What is a data catalog?"

> > "A data catalog creates and maintains an inventory of data assets through the discovery, description and organization of distributed datasets. The data catalog provides context to enable data stewards, data/business analysts, data engineers, data scientists and other line of business (LOB) data consumers to find and understand relevant datasets for the purpose of extracting business value."

## How does a data catalog work?

A data catalog links data with the assets that make it meaningful — documentation, queries, history, glossaries, etc. By combining metadata with data management, governance, and search capabilities, a data catalog helps a company organize its data, discover the right data assets, and evaluate if an asset is right for a specific use case.

**Here’s what a truly powerful data catalog can do:**

- Create a repository of all your data from various data sources, including notes on a data set’s structure, quality, definitions and usage.
- Allow users to access the metadata alongside the data itself.
- View and understand the lineage of the data—including the data source, the transformations applied and who has been using it.
- Ensure data consistency and accuracy by updating itself auto-magically, while allowing humans to edit and remain in the loop.
- Simplify data governance and compliance by providing a graphical representation of the lineage of the data assets—tracing it across its lifecycle.

## Why is a data catalog important?

According to Booz Allen Hamilton’s [Data Science Playbook](https://www.boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen_site/sig/pdf/publications/data-science-playbook.pdf), businesses that deploy analytics across most of the organization, align daily operations with senior management’s goals, and incorporate big data will see a 1,000% increase in ROI.

We all know that data is important. But nowadays, it’s not enough to have data. Only the companies that can actually harness the enormous power of data are expected to win.

The pain of siloed and missing data is real, and it’s felt across organizations. Here’s what we saw on Reddit:
